- **A brief summary of OctoAcme's project management processes**
- **Links to all process documentation in this folder**

## Project Management Process Summary

OctoAcme follows a hybrid Agile-Waterfall methodology that balances structured planning with iterative execution:

### Key Principles
- **Customer-first approach**: Prioritize customer value and usability in all decisions
- **Iterative delivery**: Deliver small, testable increments to enable rapid feedback and course correction
- **Clear ownership**: Every project has defined roles with a named Project Manager (PM) and Product Lead
- **Data-informed decisions**: Measure impact and iterate based on evidence and success metrics
- **Stakeholder alignment**: Regular communication cadence ensures transparency and alignment across teams

### Process Highlights
- **Initiation**: Projects begin with clear problem statements, measurable outcomes, and stakeholder alignment through project one-pagers
- **Planning**: Work is broken into shippable increments with defined acceptance criteria and Definition of Done
- **Execution & Tracking**: Leverages iterative sprints with regular stakeholder check-ins, daily standups, and weekly delivery syncs
- **Risk Management**: Risks are surfaced early through Risk Registers and mitigated collaboratively across teams
- **Release & Deployment**: Standardized release processes with automated pipelines, rollback plans, and post-deploy verification
- **Continuous Improvement**: Built-in retrospectives and improvement cycles capture learnings and drive ongoing enhancements
- **Measurable Outcomes**: Every project defines success metrics from the start and tracks them throughout delivery

### Roles and Accountability
Clearly defined roles ensure smooth collaboration:
- **Project Managers**: Coordinate delivery, schedules, risks, and communications
- **Product Managers**: Define outcomes, prioritize backlog, and measure success
- **Developers**: Implement features, collaborate on design and testability
- **QA/Testing**: Validate quality and acceptance criteria
- **Stakeholders**: Provide inputs and approvals at defined gates
